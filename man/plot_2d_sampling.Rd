\title{Plot 3D Contour Plot for 2D Samples}
\usage{
plot_2d_sampling(
  samples,
  target_pdf,
  from = -4,
  to = 4,
  n_contour = 30,
  main = "2D Sampling vs Theoretical PDF"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A numeric matrix or data frame with 2 columns representing the 2D sampled points.}

\item{target_pdf}{A function representing the target 2D probability distribution (used for comparison).}

\item{from}{The lower bound for the x-axis (optional).}

\item{to}{The upper bound for the x-axis (optional).}

\item{n_contour}{The number of contour levels.}

\item{main}{The title of the plot.}
}
\description{
This function plots a 3D contour plot to compare the target PDF and sampled values
in a 2D space (for methods like Gibbs or Metropolis with 2D sampling).
}
\examples{
# Define target 2D PDF (Standard Normal Distribution in both X and Y)
target_pdf_2d <- function(x, y) { dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1) * dnorm(y, mean = 0, sd = 1) }

# Generate 2D samples (e.g., from a Normal distribution)
samples_2d <- matrix(c(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000)), ncol = 2)

# Plot the 3D contour plot comparing the target PDF and sampled points
plot_2d_sampling(samples_2d, target_pdf_2d)
