Description: Provides a comprehensive suite of tools for Monte Carlo methods, 
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and Bayesian inference. 
  Implements various sampling techniques such as Gibbs Sampling, 
  the Metropolis algorithm, and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 
  Supports random number generation, expectation computation, and 
  resampling methods. Also includes optimization methods such as 
  Expectation-Maximization (EM) and applications of Gaussian 
  Processes for probabilistic modeling.
